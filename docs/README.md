## Product Vision

We Vote We Talk - An online event running Open Space Technology, where participants are able to join talks based on their personal interests by voting from a group of talks to then generate a schedule with the top voted topics.

---
## Elevator Pitch

Have you ever been to an online Open Space event, and your concentration and interests level are slowly but surely fading away? What better way to increase your interest in the event than to talk about what you actually want to listen to? 
That's exactly what WeVoteWeTalk does: we want to increase people's interest in an online Open Space event. 
We let people say want they want to talk about, then vote on the ideas that were given and finnaly a moderator generates a schedule that best suits all the attendant's interests so that everyone's experience in the event is surely improved!
After that the talks begin! Any user is free to enter/leave any talk at any moment. Thanks to this there are two roles that a participant can have: bumblebees and buterflies. Bumblebees fly from group to group cross-pollinating the discussions while Butterflies sit around looking relaxed.
Interesting discussions emerge around them as people find them and pause to chat.

## Requirements

In this section, you should describe all kinds of requirements for your module: functional and non-functional requirements.

Start by contextualizing your module, describing the main concepts, terms, roles, scope and boundaries of the application domain addressed by the project.

### Domain Model

![Domain Model](images/ProblemDomain.png) 

This project is built based on five main classes:

The **User** class represents every person that downloads and uses our application. This person can vote on any theme Idea and participate in any Session of the Conferences he knows about.

The **Moderator** is a special User. This is the person that creates a Conference and each Conference has one and only one Moderator. This person has the power to manage all the Conference related stuff.

The **Conference** is the most imortant class of our project. This makes the connection between the Users, the Ideas, the Votes and the Sessions. One Conference can have multiple Users that can give and vote on theme Ideas for the Sessions and then participate on the most voted Sessions.

The **Idea** is the Session theme. If it has enough votes there will be a Session about it.

The **Session** represents a Jitsi call where all the Users can talk to each other about the Session theme.  

## Architecture and Design

### Logical architecture

![Logical Architecture](images/LogicalArchitecture.png) 

To represent our logical architecture we use a 3-layer representation.

In the first layer we have the Data Tier which represents how information is stored. 

The second layer, the Application Tier, presents what kind of information is processed and it's flow through the application.

Finally, the third layer called Presentation Tier shows everything that the user can see and/or interact with. 

### Physical architecture

![Physical Architecture](images/PhysicalArchitecture.png) 


Our project's physical architecture uses two blocks which communicate through HTTP:
* The client side block where the Flutter app is installed.
* The server side block which contains two Firebase Services, Firebase Cloud Firestore and Firebase Authentication.

We chose Firebase due to it's pre-built authentication capabilities and due to it's real-time synchronization which is necessary for a functioning voting system.  

### Prototype
To help on validating all the architectural, design and technological decisions made, we usually implement a vertical prototype, a thin vertical slice of the system.

In this subsection please describe in more detail which, and how, user(s) story(ies) were implemented.

---

## Implementation
Regular product increments are a good practice of product management. 

While not necessary, sometimes it might be useful to explain a few aspects of the code that have the greatest potential to confuse software engineers about how it works. Since the code should speak by itself, try to keep this section as short and simple as possible.

Use cross-links to the code repository and only embed real fragments of code when strictly needed, since they tend to become outdated very soon.

---

## Test

Currently we have automated tests for the following features:

* User Login
* Brainstorm
* Join Talks
* Voting

All the tests are implemented using a package for flutter named [gherkin_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_gherkin) and are completely automated. The automated tests for this features can be seen [here](https://github.com/FEUP-ESOF-2020-21/open-cx-t5g1-wevotewetalk/tree/master/WeVoteWeTalk/we_vote_we_talk/Test).

Example of Login.feature running below.

## Configuration and change management

Configuration and change management are key activities to control change to, and maintain the integrity of, a project’s artifacts (code, models, documents).

For the purpose of ESOF, we will use a very simple approach, just to manage feature requests, bug fixes, and improvements, using GitHub issues and following the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).


---

## Project management

Software project management is an art and science of planning and leading software projects, in which software projects are planned, implemented, monitored and controlled.

In the context of ESOF, we expect that each team adopts a project management tool capable of registering tasks, assign tasks to people, add estimations to tasks, monitor tasks progress, and therefore being able to track their projects.

Example of tools to do this are:
  * [Trello.com](https://trello.com)
  * [Github Projects](https://github.com/features/project-management/com)
  * [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com)
  * [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)

We recommend to use the simplest tool that can possibly work for the team.
